# Membrane Ontology

**DISCLAIMER: Membrane Ontology is in a very basic state, and drastic changes, including the URI namespace, are highly probable.**

Membrane Ontology aims to provide a structured, unified vocabulary for the annotation of biological data pertaining to cell membranes and their experimental and computational models. This should allow not only thorough membrane descriptions but also integration between datasets, where similar membranes or models approximating the same type of biological membrane can be identified.

The first intended application of this ontology is for the description of membranes in the [MolMeDB](https://molmedb.upol.cz/detail/intro) database, mainly for categorization and connection to membrane components (mainly phospholipids) in other databases. The next step would be using Membrane Ontology to annotate membranes in [WikiPathways](https://www.wikipathways.org/) and thus link pathways to relevant data in MolMeDB. We hope for the involvement of the membrane expert community and the adoption of the ontology in other projects so we can build a more interconnected world of membrane knowledge.
